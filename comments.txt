Jackson did well in this course and I am happy with Jackson's progress.<br />
Jackson made the following comments about the course: I found the general intriduction to python very helpful as it could show what the language could do. I found the regex less useful, as I found it complicated to read and not sure when I would use it.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />
Jackson was always punctual during the 3 days of the course and was engaged during the lectures.<br /><br />
Recommendations for further learning:<br />
Practice implementing Python programming and SQL at work.<br /> When I asked what to do after the course, Jackson told me: I will continue to practice the topics covered, especially calling functions from other files.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Bimal shah<br />

Ryan did well in this course and I am happy with Ryan's progress.<br />
Ryan made the following comments about the course: I found the SQL topic useful, I learnt a lot about SQL and how to use it to interact with databases. A lot of the python topics I already had an understanding of, so these were less useful, but I was able to reinforce what I knew and learnt a few new aspects of python<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Especially with the SQL area as this is used a lot.  <br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Stephen Clarke<br />

Stephen did well in this course and I am happy with Stephen's progress.<br />
Stephen made the following comments about the course: I found the Python topic to be very informative, maybe a little confusing at times as a new language to me. But I liked the functions and how to set them, so they can be called into the program being created. I just need to practice Python more in order to learn the syntax and how it bolts together, but overall the Python was very good. SQL part was good - I do know some SQL but Mike did explain the JOIN/LEFT OUTER JOIN differences which i found very useful<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />
