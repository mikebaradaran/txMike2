Aneela made the following comments about the course: I found the terraform section to be really useful. I also really enjoyed the microservices team work we did. I found it incredibly interesting and learnt a lot. I also really liked the labs that we did, i assume that they replicate the actual work we do in our companies and can see that they are very valuable. <br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Practice implementing Microservices techniques at work.<br /> When I asked what to do after the course, Aneela told me: I think I would like to learn more about terraform on the cloud academy. There are a lot of resources and labs available on microservices and api's I can try to further consolidate my learning <br /><br />--------------------------------<br />
