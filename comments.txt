General comments:<br />
Oliver did well in this course and I am happy with Oliver's progress.<br />
Oliver made the following comments about the course: I found the Regex stuff very useful as I use it for web development in JavaScript but never fully understood how it worked. I also found the modules in Python interesting as it can help with cleaner code.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />
Oliver was always punctual during the 5 days of the course and was engaged during the lectures.<br /><br />
Recommendations for further learning:<br />
Practice writing Python apps and running SQL scripts on the databases at work.<br /> When I asked what to do after the course, Oliver told me: Practise Regex on RegExr to develop a better understanding of it and also use SQLZoo to improve at SQL queries.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Leo<br />
