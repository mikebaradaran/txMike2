Alex did well in this course and I am happy with Alex's progress.<br />
Alex made the following comments about the course: I found that JQuery and Angular were the most useful topics that I learned. As I enjoyed how dynamic the web pages became. Same with Ajax, which I really enjoyed using bits of data from a web page. <br />
The topics that I found less useful was HTML, as I had already done alot of HTML before, but it was a nice refresher.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />
