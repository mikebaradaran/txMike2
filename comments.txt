Olivia made the following comments about the course: Good introduction to microservices and APIS and their use/place in a functional web application. Similar to other courses, had pre-existing knowledge of this area and while AWS knowledge is beneficial we don't use this in Azure so will be looking to do additional work on learning more about Kubernetes and hosting microservices on more work-specific architecture.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />
