Mazen did well in this course and I am happy with Mazen's progress.<br />
Mazen made the following comments about the course: JavaScript was excellent - Along with JQuery. HTML and CSS I was already very comfortable so personally i did not learn much here but I learnt loads on JavaScript and JQuery as my understanding of these topics was previously very shaky. I did not realise how effective JavaScript can be. I can see now a lot of things I would previously have done on the server could potentially be done client side. Specifically around APIs. <br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Jed did well in this course and I am happy with Jed's progress.<br />
Jed made the following comments about the course: The introductions to javascript and how the internet works, gave me a deeper knowledge of the language and web development and I now know how javascript works "under the hood" of other frameworks/libraries. I found the brief topics on html and css less useful as I had a strong understanding prior to this.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Andrew did well in this course and I am happy with Andrew's progress.<br />
Andrew made the following comments about the course: The modules on Angular and JQuery were the most useful for me personally, because I didn't really have any prior knowledge of these. It's difficult to say which modules may have been less useful, because they were all extremely well presented, and contained lots of examples and screenshots etc.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />
