Kwela did well in this course and I am happy with Kwela's progress.<br />
Kwela made the following comments about the course: I really enjoy creating the server.<br />For the HTML & CSS part, I would have liked it if we could have done a mini survey at the beginning of the course to know exactly if it was needed for our group. Then perhaps we would have saved time to include testing in the course.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Thuy made the following comments about the course: Thank you Mike!<br />
Really like the little antidotes you give i.e. who created the internet, first insurance company to sell online. It stuck with me and I went to google afterwards.

I enjoy seeing the projects you created and your enthusiasm for learning. I.e. the solar system animation made from html and css, really cool. Prompted me to go try it out myself.

API, React - components, hooks, props, re jservers I tried to use it on pre-course but wasn't able to do it. However I managed to get it working yesterday.

I found it challenging following some of tasks yesterday when we can into a couple of issues. Far less knowledgeable than the others and found following the conversation difficult.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />
