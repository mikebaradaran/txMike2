Practice designing and implementing websites at work.<br /> When I asked what to do after the course, Liam told me: I will be looking further into javascript and jQuery. I have been doing basic web dev for around 8 years, and have NEVER touched anything js related. <br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Mital Patel<br />

Mazen did well in this course and I am happy with Mazen's progress.<br />
Mazen made the following comments about the course: JavaScript was excellent - Along with JQuery. HTML and CSS I was already very comfortable so personally i did not learn much here but I learnt loads on JavaScript and JQuery as my understanding of these topics was previously very shaky. I did not realise how effective JavaScript can be. I can see now a lot of things I would previously have done on the server could potentially be done client side. Specifically around APIs. <br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />
