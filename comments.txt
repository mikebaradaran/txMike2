Oliver did well in this course and I am happy with Oliver's progress.<br />
Oliver made the following comments about the course: I found the Regex stuff very useful as I use it for web development in JavaScript but never fully understood how it worked. I also found the modules in Python interesting as it can help with cleaner code.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />
Oliver was always punctual during the 5 days of the course and was engaged during the lectures.<br /><br />
Recommendations for further learning:<br />
Practice writing Python apps and running SQL scripts on the databases at work.<br /> When I asked what to do after the course, Oliver told me: Practise Regex on RegExr to develop a better understanding of it and also use SQLZoo to improve at SQL queries.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Leo<br />

Christiano made the following comments about the course: The basics were informative, I'm more comfortable with using Python and SQL especially. Found it difficult s someone who has never used these languages before as we did not go through the basics for SQL and was very daunting. Introduced to a big Database and not shown how to go about creating databases or even how we would connect them to entries. <br />
Overall, a lot of theoretical basics we learnt but I would have to do a lot of research to apply those skills, to a current project.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Practice writing Python apps and running SQL scripts on the databases at work.<br /> When I asked what to do after the course, Christiano told me: I should research in depth about SQL and the initialization of databases.<br />I should research how to connect databases to websites and apps so that I can actually use them.
I Should research ways in which I can apply Python to my work.

Viktorija did well in this course and I am happy with Viktorija's progress.<br />
Viktorija made the following comments about the course: I enjoyed learning more about tuples, sets and list comprehension. These were some basic topics that I could never quite get my head around, however after the course with Mike I feel a lot more confident in my abilities. Some of the topics were a little bit difficult to grasp in such a short period of time, such as pickling in Python. I feel that maybe a 5 day course would be more suitable for this as there are many interesting and useful subjects to learn that take time to learn. Mike did a great job, however I think with a little bit more time it could have been even better.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Practice writing Python apps and running SQL scripts on the databases at work.<br /> When I asked what to do after the course, Viktorija told me: There are certain types of data that we store in MongoDB databases within the company I work at, however I have not been exposed to them much. I'd like to learn how to query and connect to noSQL databases using Python to further expand my knowledge. After the course, I will speak to my mentor at work and request additional training regarding MongoDB.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br />bilal osman<br />

Jennifer did well in this course and I am happy with Jennifer's progress.<br />
Jennifer made the following comments about the course: SQL scripts was useful to know. Although I know some of the keywords, it is useful to know the other keywords too. I feel like I wouldn't be able to do a lot of the functions because we have a SQL team at work who handle a lot of the database stuff. The least useful to know, was some python although it was still useful for anything I do in the future. <br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Practice writing Python apps and running SQL scripts on the databases at work.<br /> When I asked what to do after the course, Jennifer told me: I would like to use more python because I heard it's an easy language to learn but this would have to be more in my own time.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br />
