Finding some of the options with an ever changing AWS landscape has been 'fun' but getting there.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Aneela Hussain<br />

Olivia did well in this course and I am happy with Olivia's progress.<br />
Olivia made the following comments about the course: The course wasn't too bad but it felt rather unstructured and for me personally I didn't feel overly challenged though I had quite a lot of knowledge around DevOps coming into this course; for a majority of the second day I felt was spent debugging the lab we were given to try and get it work. The instructions in the document weren't very clear which meant there was a lot of backtracking to redo steps so I think it should be reviewed ahead of the course to prevent this from occurring, I also think it would be good to provide code snippets in .txt documents to ensure formatting isn't lost as this was an issue when copying code from the word document into visual studio code.<br />
The docker demo was good though I prefer to have slides and content to go along with what is being demonstrated to elaborate on what each step is actually aiming to achieve but that may just be personal preference as obviously everyone works different! Overall not a bad course and I'm sure it's beneficial for people with little to no DevOps experience.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Practice implementing DevOps techniques at work.<br /> When I asked what to do after the course, Olivia told me: I'm looking forwards to working more in Azure and learning more about utilising this platform for scalability and deployment as it is more relevant to my work but I think more experience working with Docker will prove beneficial in the future as well.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Samuel Baston<br /> 
General comments:<br />
Samuel did well in this course and I am happy with Samuel's progress.<br />
Samuel made the following comments about the course: I believe the sections surrounding pipelines, CI/CD, etc were the most useful as it is an important part of the software lifecycle I had only theoretical knowledge of previously. Similarly, I enjoyed the docker demo, which was concise and well-explained. <br />I believe the sections of team structure/frameworks such as Agile, Scrum, Kanban, etc were the least useful to me as I've covered those areas in greater detail for other material as well as the workplace.

Practice implementing DevOps techniques at work.<br /> When I asked what to do after the course, Samuel told me: To further improve my skills, I would like to become more familiar and practised with CI/CD processes, particularly in the Azure platform as this is what I generally use over AWS. <br />Likewise, doing test scenarios with docker would be a valuable addition. <br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Jordan Spencer<br />
