Joanna did well in this course and I am happy with Joanna's progress.<br />
Joanna made the following comments about the course: I found all the topics useful and learnt a lot about deployment and the tools to do this. The AWS work was the most useful as this is a system I am using at work, having the lab practice was helpful with aspects of AWS which I haven't used at work yet such as AWS Amplify.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

General comments:<br />
Jacob did well in this course and I am happy with Jacob's progress.<br />
Jacob made the following comments about the course: I found the first few days useful, learning CI CD and how that applies to DevOps. The docker parts were less useful as unfortunately I couldn't get docker working on my machine and they didn't work on the provided VMs. Working through it as a group isn't as useful for my learning style as I'm not really doing anything.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Nathan did well in this course and I am happy with Nathan's progress.<br />
Nathan made the following comments about the course: Learning about the different ways agile methodologies can be implemented was the most helpful to me at my company. However the AWS was less helpful and azure would have been preferred if possible.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

To do this during the lessons would mean a large number of disruptive system reboots. <br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Sam Metcalfe<br />

Nandan made the following comments about the course: I found the second day the most useful, as I learnt how to create environments using AWS, as well as deploy software into the environments.

I also felt that comments people made on the chat were not noticed.  I was able to talk during the course, but others may have preferred using the chat.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Alexandra Fratiman<br /> 
General comments:<br />
Alexandra did well in this course and I am happy with Alexandra's progress.<br />
Alexandra made the following comments about the course: Useful - labs contained almost the full instructions, which made it possible for a beginner to do if asking further questions<br />Useful - teacher well aware of what is and what isn't achievable in the time and with the experience level we had
Less useful - having a secondary app that we needed to interact with the teacher through (switching between apps and being asked to do that quickly was stressful). We use webex already  so ideally everything can be done through it, or at the very least messages and attendance.
Less useful - duplicate requirements, such as the one I mentioned above, also filling in this feedback form AND the feedback form that QA sends through about the same class
