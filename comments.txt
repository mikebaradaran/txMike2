Aneela made the following comments about the course: I found the terraform section to be really useful. I also really enjoyed the microservices team work we did. I found it incredibly interesting and learnt a lot. I also really liked the labs that we did, i assume that they replicate the actual work we do in our companies and can see that they are very valuable. <br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Practice implementing Microservices techniques at work.<br /> When I asked what to do after the course, Aneela told me: I think I would like to learn more about terraform on the cloud academy. There are a lot of resources and labs available on microservices and api's I can try to further consolidate my learning <br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Olivia<br />

Olivia did well in this course and I am happy with Olivia's progress.<br />
Olivia made the following comments about the course: Good introduction to microservices and APIS and their use/place in a functional web application. Similar to other courses, had pre-existing knowledge of this area and while AWS knowledge is beneficial we don't use this in Azure so will be looking to do additional work on learning more about Kubernetes and hosting microservices on more work-specific architecture.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />
