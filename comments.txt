Mustafa made the following comments about the course: Really found the kanban board and the user stories module very useful. Using Trello was great, LOVED the kahoots. By far the most informative and interactive session I've had with a teacher. Thanks Mike :)<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Cristiano made the following comments about the course: The Agile course covered some useful fundamentals about Agile methodology, especially in terms of understanding the core principles and frameworks like Scrum. These aspects provided a good foundation for someone like me, who is looking to apply Agile in real-world projects. However, the delivery could have been more engaging. The trainer's tendency to focus on negative examples and long tangents sometimes detracted from the learning experience. While the Kahoot games aimed to make things interactive, they didnâ€™t feel particularly beneficial to reinforcing key concepts.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Additionally, practicing Agile methodologies in projects will help solidify the concepts and make the learning more relevant and engaging.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Alice Mooney<br />

Alice did well in this course and I am happy with Alice's progress.<br />
Alice made the following comments about the course: I found it useful to learn about the SDLC, the roles and responsibilities and to dive deeper into how testing is done. At times it felt slightly difficult to focus on theory when I lack practical experience, but I appreciate this is a chicken/egg situation. It was a great introduction into the Agile theory. Thanks Mike! <br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

I will meet with the team scrum master next week and reflect on my learning and ask him any further questions I have and learn more about how we implement this within our team. I am also looking forward to getting stuck into more practical work in future. <br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Terrii Flanagan<br />

Paul made the following comments about the course: It was a good course that went in to a lot of detail and broke the subject down. There was a lot to take in so it wasn't easy for me to take in absolutely everything but I have a copy of the presentation slides so I can go back over them to refresh my learning. <br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />
