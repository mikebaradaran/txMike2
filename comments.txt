Annie did well in this course and I am happy with Annie's progress.<br />
Annie made the following comments about the course: I have found it really useful to learn about Docker and how it works. It was interesting to see how Docker containers can encapsulate everything needed to run applications. I liked that we were given enough time to go through everything at our own pace.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />
Annie was always punctual during the 2 days of the course and was engaged during the lectures.<br /><br />
Recommendations for further learning:<br />
Practice designing and implementing Microservices and APIs at work.<br /> When I asked what to do after the course, Annie told me: I would like to experiment further with the labs and read up on Kubernetes.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Margaret (Malgorzata) Kaminska<br />

Rohan did well in this course and I am happy with Rohan's progress.<br />
Rohan made the following comments about the course: I found docker useful but I still don't like it, it makes me angry in ways no other software can haha. I did manage to get it working with the node:18-alpine base image and I learned a lot about dockerfiles while figuring out why it didn't work.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Anna did well in this course and I am happy with Anna's progress.<br />
Anna made the following comments about the course: As I am going to be working with Docker at some point in the future, learning the basics was very useful. I enjoyed doing the exercises (and helping with making the docs better), but I would prefer if they were more connected, i.e. making a gradual change to the same example to show different ways of working with Docker as circumstances change. At least for the foreseeable future, I will not be working with AWS, so going over basics is useful, but will have to learn everything again if I ever must use it.<br />I was very happy to go over CI/CD as it allowed me to understand the process of deployment better (especially from the perspective of my work where we are introducing a TDD).<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Practice designing and implementing Microservices and APIs at work.<br /> When I asked what to do after the course, Anna told me: The course was my first encounter with creating containers, images and networks in Docker, so to make sure the knowledge I gained is consolidated I will have to create a pet-project (at least currently as I am not working with Docker) to practice and experiment with different outcomes. Basically make, break and fix the environment. To make sure I understand the topic on a working level I would have to dive deeper and constantly experiment.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Robert Angelitud<br />
