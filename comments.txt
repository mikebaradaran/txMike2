Joanna did well in this course and I am happy with Joanna's progress.<br />
Joanna made the following comments about the course: I found all the topics useful and learnt a lot about deployment and the tools to do this.

General comments:<br />
Jacob did well in this course and I am happy with Jacob's progress.<br />
Jacob made the following comments about the course: I found the first few days useful, learning CI CD and how that applies to DevOps. The docker parts were less useful as unfortunately I couldn't get docker working on my machine and they didn't work on the provided VMs. Working through it as a group isn't as useful for my learning style as I'm not really doing anything.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />
